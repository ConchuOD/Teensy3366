Here's everything that I used, but remember this isn't what I'd recommend.

### Hardware:

### Tools:
(I've linked the components I used - this isn't a general recommendation. My reason for using most of this stuff is because it was cheap or I already owned it, not because its nessesarily good. If you're able to afford to take on a similar project, I'd recommend seeking advice in choosing high quality products.)
* [Soldering Kit](http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/maplin-40w-mains-soldering-iron-kit-n72hy) (Included iron, Desoldering Pump, solder and block with sponge.)

* 22 AWG Wire (ideally solid core, but I used [this](http://uk.farnell.com/adafruit-industries/153/wire-bundle-breadboard/dp/2409349))
* Solder & Flux (e.g. [this](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00KCL61M8))
* [Multimeter](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00YUJ6OSE)
